    <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to the start of my coding career! Obviously you already know my name, but allow me to tell you a little bit more about myself and my journey to start a career in software development. I have always had an interest in computers, and in highschool I had the opportunity to get my hands dirty in trying a programming and robotics class. This experience led me to try coding off and on as I kept a day job doing various other things, such as being a server and construction worker. Realizing that these kinds of jobs would not allow me to reach the kind of career or pay I would want, I decided to fully commit to learning coding and web development full time and make it my career. I am excited about the opportunities Epicodus has provided and look forward to the many challenges that lay ahead.</p>
